## Abstract

Synthetic power distribution grids are essential for testing and validating new algorithms and technologies in power systems. This paper introduces a novel Bayesian hierarchical model for generating realistic, statistically representative, and structurally diverse synthetic unbalanced power distribution networks. Our approach models the topological and electrical characteristics of distribution grids by defining probability distributions for key parameters such as line impedances, load distributions, and network topology. The hierarchical structure of the model allows for the generation of entire feeder archetypes, capturing the variability observed within and between different classes of distribution networks. We validate our model by comparing the statistical properties of the generated synthetic grids with those of real-world utility-provided datasets. The results demonstrate that our method can produce synthetic networks that are statistically indistinguishable from real ones, providing a valuable tool for researchers and engineers in the power systems community.
